Work Rank is a short python script that ranks the words
of a text file according to their frequency. It puts the
words in a dictionary; each word is the key, and the
frequency is the value. It then prints the dictionary in
ascending order of frequency.

Usage example:

$ python wordRank.py test.txt

test: 1
text: 1
a: 2
document: 2
random: 2
is: 3
